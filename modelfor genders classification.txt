If you get any error like tqdm.contrib.logging module not found , use below command on anaconda prompt
pip install "git+https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm.git@devel#egg=tqdm"

Might need to install FER , tensorflow, keras etc 

Below pre-trained models needs to be used for age and gender , install them from the git path
